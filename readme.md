## AOS

Small library to animate elements on your page as you scroll. 

You may say it's like WOWJS, yeah - you're right, effect is similar to WOWJS, but I had a different idea how to make such a plugin, so here it is. CSS3 driven scroll animation library.

AOS allows you to animate elements as you scroll down, and up. If you scroll back to top, elements will animate to it's previous state and are ready to animate again if you scroll down.
